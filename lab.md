The University of Houston Brain-Machine Interface Systems Team (UH BMIST) is a research group led by Dr. Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston Main Campus. They are dedicated to the engineering of the brain, and the design of non-invasive brain-machine interface and robotic systems for rehabilitation, enhancement or repair of the motor system after brain or body injury, neurological insults, or advanced aging. In addition, the group members focus on the studies of how to utilize neural interfaces as tools for reverse-translational studies of brain plasticity and brain-machine interaction/confluence, how to build bio-robotics and powered wearable exoskeletons, and how to make fast, reliable, non-invasive brain-smartphone/device interfaces.
