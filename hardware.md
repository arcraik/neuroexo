<p>This EEG cap prototype is designed specifically for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Keeping cost and ease of use forefront, the design minimizes material to result in a sleek design. In its current stage, the design is intended to work with the projectâ€™s software to test its efficacy. Final designs will implement dry electrodes to allow stroke patients to set up the device independently.</p>
