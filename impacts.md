<h3>STEM Outreach at the Children's Museum of Houston</h3>
During the week of July 7-13, 2019 our lab visited the Children’s Museum of Houston to demonstrate EEG technology to children as part of our STEM Outreach Program. The children got to wear EEG caps and learn how brains send/receive signals to/from the rest of the body. Children and parents were able to see their brain activity in real-time up on a screen. As part of the lab’s “Brain on Art” STEM Program, the children participated in a hands-on creative art activity to demonstrate how the brain behaves while they make art.

<h3>Neurotech Entrepreneurs Workshop</h3>
Prof. Contreras-Vidal is co-chair of the <a href="https://brain.ieee.org/news/neurotech-entrepreneurs-workshop">Neurotech Entrepreneurs Workshop</a> to be held at Arizona State University on December 13-15, 2019 - a collaboration by Arizona State University, IEEE Brain, NSF IUCRC BRAIN Center, University of Houston, and the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of this workshop is to provide intensive and rigorous training in the areas of: ideation, market analysis, customer and stakeholder analysis, intellectual property, regulatory affairs, reimbursement, valuation, and fundraising. As part of this workshop, students will be given challenges prevalent in the neurotechnology industry and will present their startup solutions to industry leaders.  Additionally, students will be given the opportunity to network with industry and academic leaders in the neurotechnology field.
