<p align = "justify">My name is Edgar Guzman, 5 th year electrical and computer engineer with a minor in math currently attending California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. I am part of the REU program at the University of Houston, working in Dr. Jose Luis Contreras laboratory. Given my previous research experience that emphasized on software, I believe I am able to contribute with coding in this project. Growing up with physical difficulties, I have always dreamed of being able to use engineering to make a social difference. Thus, being able to work on a project that assist individual that had suffered from a stroke allows me to feel accomplished, as I am making a positive impact on the world.</p>
