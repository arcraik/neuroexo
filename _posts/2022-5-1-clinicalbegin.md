title: Clinical Trials Begin
---

<p align="justify"> Clinical trials begin with the NeuroEXOâ€™s first participant. The clinical trials are made up of six sessions at the clinic, where the participant will get accustomed to the system and the system collects data to train a machine learning model. Following the clinical trials and assuming the participant opts to continue, the participant will take the system home for 6 weeks of at-home trials. </p>
