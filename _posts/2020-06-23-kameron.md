<p>My name is Kameron Moore and I am a rising senior pursuing undergraduate degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Spanish Linguistics from Arizona State University. This summer, I am participating in the Houston REU program working with Dr. Pepe Contreras-Vidal and PhD student Alex Craik as my supervisors on the NeuroExo project. I have previous research experience studying ADHD characteristics at Arizona State University in the Memory and Attention Control Lab where I aided in collecting and analyzing human subject trial data. In the private sector, I have been able to work with biomedical device manufacturer, Cranial Technologies, Inc., in the research and development department gaining knowledge on producing working prototypes as well as exposure to programming in MATLAB, 3D printing, and materials testing. From my coursework and position as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in a product design lab at ASU, I have experience working with a variety of technologies collaboratively and leading others in academic projects. I thoroughly enjoy working on real-world problems to discover real-world solutions and am honored to be a part of Houstonâ€™s summer REU program where I have been given the opportunities to expand my knowledge of brain-computer-interfaces and aid in the development of a technology that will improve the lives of stroke survivors.</p>
