<p align="justify"> The clinical trials were deemed a success, so the system moves to the participants home for the start of the 6-week at-home phase. During these 6 weeks, the participant will use the system 5 days / 10 sessions a week. Following the at-home trials, the participantâ€™s motor ability will be assessed. </p>
