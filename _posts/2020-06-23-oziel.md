<p>My name is Oziel Román Cantú López and I am a part of the team working in the Noninvasive Brain-Machine Interface Systems Lab as an international trainee for the 2020 summer at University of Houston. I am an undergraduate biomedical engineer senior that have been working on the design and implementation of many different medical and non-medical devices; my programming skills, curiosity and problem solving thinking may have brought new ways to analyze and optimize some signal processing processes. The project we are working on is related to rehabilitation of stroke survivors. When I was admitted to the project I couldn’t be more excited because for the last two years I’ve been planning on getting my own rehabilitation clinic; working on this project as an initial approach to the topic meant something big for me as I can now start helping people and get the knowledge to try to give them the quality of life they deserve by creating the technology of the future.</p>
