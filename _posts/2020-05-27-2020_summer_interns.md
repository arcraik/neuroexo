<p>This summer, the NeuroExo project will have the support of four interns. This includes two students from the <a href="http://reu.egr.uh.edu/">Research Experiences for Undergraduates program</a> (Edgar Guzman and Kameron Moore), a graduate student (Oziel Román Cantú López), and a local high school student (Vinay Mannem). While the pandemic has forced these internships to switch from in-person experiences to a virtual program, we expect these students will have a rewarding experience in gaining and improving the skill sets necessary for successful academic research.</p>
