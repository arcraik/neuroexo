title: Difficult Lessons during Firmware Development
---

<p align="justify">One unfortunate characteristic of the BeagleBone Black board is that it requires an ethernet connection for wifi connectivity. This necessarily means that our system would not be entirely portable. Fortunately, this year the manufacturer of the BBB released a wireless BBB.  A portable system is preferable for many reasons, such as user friendliness and ease of headset adjustment, so we decided to purchase a wireless unit. With a few minor adjustments, we were able to port our system to the wireless board and communicate as expected between all pieces of hardware wirelessly.</p>
