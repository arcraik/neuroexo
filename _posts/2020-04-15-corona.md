<p align = "justify">The coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted all of our lives and our lab is no different. The movement and human subject testing restrictions now in place have forced modifications to the original NeuroExo plan. This includes the cessation of the originally planned human clinical testing over the summer. Additionally, due to product delays, we must now source a different processing unit for the Brain Machine Interface. Bench testing of this new processing unit will replace the originally scheduled clinical tests for the summer in preparation for the at-home tests in 2021.</p>
