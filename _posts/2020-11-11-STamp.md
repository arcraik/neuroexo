title: Custom Amplifier Design and Integration with Beagle Bone Black
---

<p>An important characteristic for an at-home stroke rehabilitation device is low cost. To achieve this constraint, rather than processing through a commercial amplifier and processing board, which are prohibitively expensive, we’ve designed a custom EEG amplifier for integration with a commercial open-sourced processing board- the Beagle Bone Black. For integration, we’ve joined with a third-party designer, Stryker-Tech (www.Stryker-Tech.com), who assisted us in the development of a combined EEG amplifier and Beagle Bone Black processing board (https://www.beagleboard.org/black). Pictured is our original amplifier design during testing and the intermediate amplifier cape. The next step is to bench test the board for functionality, designate components for removal, and work with our partners at Stryker-Tech to reduce the form factor for our final design.</p>
