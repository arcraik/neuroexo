<p align="justify"> My project is to 3D print and assemble the EEG headsets so that they can be used for testing. Parts in contact with the patient are made of medical-grade flexible resin. The main housing is made from nylon, the gears are made of polycarbonate, and the connecting plate is made from PLA. For assembly, I need to attach wires to the probes and insert them into the parts, assembling everything except the electronics in the back housing. </p>
